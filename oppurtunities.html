			<p class="paragraph">Virtual reality is often used for marketing purposes, especially in tourism. Studies find that consumers are more likely to visit a destination if they experience it in VR first. Virtual reality is also commonly used in the workplace, especially with training. Osso VR is a training platform for surgeons, which allows surgeons to learn new technique anywhere, in a cost effective way.
